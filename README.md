# R Programming Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **R scripts** focused on core concepts in **data exploration, preprocessing, statistical modeling, and machine learning**. Each script demonstrates a specific technique or model using R. They cover the end-to-end data science workflow from exploration to model evaluation.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following R scripts, each focusing on a specific topic:

- `DataExploration.R`
- `preprocessing.R`
- `regression.R`
- `kc_house_data_stepAIC.R`
- `ResidualAnalysis.R`
- `VIF_multicollinearity.R`
- `DecisionTree_1.R`
- `kNN.R`
- `Confusion_Scording_Metrics.R`
- `clustering.R`

Each script is self-contained and includes comments explaining the steps and logic used.
